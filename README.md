# LeanForensics
Building a Lean management system for the Forensics Lab at BCIT.

A system that can track all the different types of work that has been requested, what work has been done, and what still needs to get done.

Also needs a visual so you can see what work needs to be done still, and be able to dig deeper into submissions for details about time and date submitted, what type of work(for example, like a blood sample)
